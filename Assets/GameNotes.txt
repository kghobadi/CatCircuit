Cat Game
- Need to work more on scratch animations
- Walking scratch should be focused on scratching in Front of where the cat is currentely facing
	- the red mark can be generated as a little obj in front of the cat and damage other cats/players
	- Should do a version of the scratch from the sitting pose
- Work more on house logic
- Friendly houses that you meow/purr at  have random chance of letting you inside
 - Play door open sound and teleport cat to interior mini-game/weird cinematic 
- Once basic cat combat (hiss/scratch) works, can add other dangerous enemies 
	- Dogs
	- Police
	- Mailmen 
	- Birds? 
	- Cars can hurt u (run you over) 
- How are the levels laid out? 
- If multiple players can play, need to determine camera behavior.
	- Could follow the average of the players on screen then lock movement past certain points
	- Could have each screen be a concrete set of space (e.g. cross st, certain # of houses)
- Indoor sequences could have more work from team members 
- Other enemies/location density would be helpful from team members
